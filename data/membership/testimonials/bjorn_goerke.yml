testimonial: "Tomitribe was founded with the sole purpose to champion and support Open Source Java EE. Jakarta EE represents the perfect union of these two concepts making the phrase “Open Source Java EE” redundant. We are incredibly excited to double down on our mission statement and work alongside the community in this once-in-a-lifetime transformation of a 20 year-old industry backbone. We believe the next 20 years have the potential to be a technical and community renaissance in cloud-native Java, uniting forces from all across the industry into one powerful ecosystem of unparalleled investment."
